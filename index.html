        Complete the function that receives as input a string, and produces outputs according to the following table:<br>
<br>
        Input	                Output<br>
        "Jabroni"	            "Patron Tequila"<br>
        "School Counselor"	    "Anything with Alcohol"<br>
        "Programmer"	        "Hipster Craft Beer"<br>
        "Bike Gang Member"	    "Moonshine"<br>
        "Politician"	        "Your tax dollars"<br>
        "Rapper"	            "Cristal"<br>
        anything else	        "Beer"<br>
<br>
        Note: anything else is the default case: if the input to the function is not any of the values in the table, then the return value should be "Beer".<br>
<br>
        Make sure you cover the cases where certain words do not show up with correct capitalization. For example, the input "pOLitiCIaN" should still return "Your tax dollars".<br>
